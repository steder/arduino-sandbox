## TODO

1. Make chirp i2c sensor work

I think we've got this too

3. Get dev environment and project cleaned up

3. Store WIFI SSID and Password Securely

4. Figure out way to set SSID / Password via Screen?  Bluetooth?  iOS app?

5. Write some code to send message out

6. Write a service to receive and store message 

7. Makefile for automated builds

We'll want to automate the builds at some point
