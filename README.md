## TODO

1. Make chirp i2c sensor work I think we have this code in `ArduinoIDE/chirp_control`

2. Make WIFI work I think we've got this too

3. Get dev environment and project cleaned up

4. Store WIFI SSID and Password Securely

5. Figure out way to set SSID / Password via Screen?  Bluetooth?  iOS app?

6. Write some code to send message out

7. Write a service to receive and store message

8. Makefile for automated builds

We'll want to automate the builds at some point
